## üîç Research on Language Models for Swimlane Chatbot

### üìå Objective

To build a chatbot that accurately answers client questions using structured and unstructured development portal data (text, swimlane flows, OpenAPI specs, etc.) with 90%+ accuracy.

---

### üìä Evaluation Criteria

The models were evaluated based on:

- **Context Length:** Ability to handle large flows and documentation
- **Reasoning:** Understanding and inferring from multi-step flows and decisions
- **Integration:** Compatibility with LangChain and Streamlit
- **Prompt Accuracy:** Response consistency and clarity
- **Cost Efficiency:** Token pricing and accessibility
- **Latency:** Real-time performance for chat use
- **Security:** Suitability for secure environments

- **Use Case Fit:** Great for prototyping and standard flows

#### 2. **OpenAI GPT-4.1**

- **Provider:** OpenAI
- **Strengths:** High accuracy, deep reasoning, longer context window (up to 128k tokens)
- **Limitations:** Higher cost and slower response
- **Use Case Fit:** Best for production-grade chatbots with complex flows

#### 3. **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**

- **Provider:** Google
- **Strengths:** Long context handling, multimodal input (text + image), strong logical reasoning
- **Limitations:** Limited LangChain support, still maturing ecosystem
- **Use Case Fit:** Ideal if working with mixed formats like OpenAPI specs + visuals

#### 4. **Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet**

- **Provider:** Anthropic
- **Strengths:** Fast, safe, very strong at flow-based understanding

### Summary & Recommendation
-Evaluation Metrics Focus: Based on criteria like cost efficiency, integration simplicity, reasoning capability, and latency benchmarks (as captured in FlowBench and LMSYS Chatbot Arena), GPT-3.5 Turbo emerged as the most balanced choice for the current stage of development.

-Prototype Testing Outcome: GPT-3.5 Turbo provided consistent and quick responses when tested with two swimlane flows‚Äî"Order Processing" and "Credit Card Approval." It effectively handled domain-specific vocabulary and maintained coherent flow interpretation.

-GPT-4.1 Consideration: While GPT-4.1 demonstrated superior reasoning and understanding in research (e.g., FlowBench), its high latency and token costs make it less practical for iterative prototyping. It could be adopted in production for critical workflows requiring high decision integrity.

-Claude 3 Sonnet Strength: Claude 3 Sonnet showed reliable accuracy and safety in decision-heavy workflows. It was particularly promising in structured rule-based Q&A. However, access restrictions and cost positioned it as a future upgrade option rather than an immediate solution.

-Gemini 1.5 Pro Outlook: Gemini 1.5 Pro impressed with its long context handling and potential for multimodal integration, including diagrams and OpenAPI schemas. Yet, its limited compatibility with LangChain and emerging support status presented short-term hurdles.

Final Justification: GPT-3.5 Turbo stands out for its:

Seamless LangChain integration (reducing development time)
Supportive cost for agile experimentation
Real-time performance, which suits interactive apps like Streamlit-based workflows
Consistency in answering queries based on flow-based procedural knowledge
