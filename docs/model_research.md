## üîç Research on Language Models for Swimlane Chatbot

### üìå Objective

To build a chatbot that accurately answers client questions using structured and unstructured development portal data (text, swimlane flows, OpenAPI specs, etc.) with 90%+ accuracy.

---

### üìä Evaluation Criteria

The models were evaluated based on:

- **Context Length:** Ability to handle large flows and documentation
- **Reasoning:** Understanding and inferring from multi-step flows and decisions
- **Integration:** Compatibility with LangChain and Streamlit
- **Prompt Accuracy:** Response consistency and clarity
- **Cost Efficiency:** Token pricing and accessibility
- **Latency:** Real-time performance for chat use
- **Security:** Suitability for secure environments

### üß† Evaluated Models

#### 1. **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**

- **Provider:** OpenAI
- **Strengths:** Fast, cost-effective, integrates well with LangChain
- **Limitations:** May struggle with complex reasoning or long flows
- **Use Case Fit:** Great for prototyping and standard flows

#### 2. **OpenAI GPT-4.1**

- **Provider:** OpenAI
- **Strengths:** High accuracy, deep reasoning, longer context window (up to 128k tokens)
- **Limitations:** Higher cost and slower response
- **Use Case Fit:** Best for production-grade chatbots with complex flows

#### 3. **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**

- **Provider:** Google
- **Strengths:** Long context handling, multimodal input (text + image), strong logical reasoning
- **Limitations:** Limited LangChain support, still maturing ecosystem
- **Use Case Fit:** Ideal if working with mixed formats like OpenAPI specs + visuals

#### 4. **Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet**

- **Provider:** Anthropic
- **Strengths:** Fast, safe, very strong at flow-based understanding
- **Limitations:** Cost and API access limitations
- **Use Case Fit:** Excellent for rule-based processes and document Q&A

#### 5. **Mistral 7B (via HuggingFace)**

- **Provider:** Open Source
- **Strengths:** Free, privacy-preserving, deployable locally
- **Limitations:** Lower accuracy for complex tasks, slower without GPU
- **Use Case Fit:** Good fallback for local/offline use
